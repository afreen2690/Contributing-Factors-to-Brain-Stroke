# Statistical Analysis of Contributing Factors to Brain Stroke
## Introduction
According to the World Health Organization (2020), brain strokes stand as a significant global health concern, being a leading cause of disability and death. Strokes manifest as abrupt disruptions of brain activity, categorized into ischemic strokes caused by blockages in brain blood vessels and hemorrhagic strokes resulting from vessel ruptures. The ischemic variant is particularly prevalent.

In our endeavor to understand and potentially mitigate the risks associated with strokes, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of a dataset encompassing various attributes, ranging from medical indicators like hypertension and average glucose levels to lifestyle choices such as smoking habits and work type.

This report presents a statistical analysis of these factors, aiming to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights that could inform preventive measures and enhance awareness about the significance of certain risk factors in relation to brain strokes. Through our exploration, we aim to shed light on the intricate web of determinants that play a role in stroke occurrences and offer recommendations based on our findings.

## Dataset
The "Brain Stroke Dataset" used for this project, obtained from Kaggle, captures health and lifestyle details of individuals to assess stroke risks. The dataset includes attributes such as gender, age, hypertension status, heart disease presence, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, BMI, smoking habits, and a binary indicator for stroke occurrence.

Rows: Approximately 4900
Columns: 11
Data Types: Primarily categorical and numeric (floating-point)
Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring patterns, distributions, and relationships within the data.
Statistical Analysis: Conducting statistical tests and analyses to derive meaningful insights.
Data Visualization: Creating visual representations of key findings.
Recommendations: Summarizing conclusions and offering actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

# Getting Started
To run the R project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone [repository_url]

Install necessary R packages: install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", ...))

Execute the R scripts in the specified order.

Feel free to explore, analyze, and visualize the data, contributing to a deeper understanding of the factors influencing brain strokes. We encourage collaboration and the sharing of insights to collectively contribute to stroke prevention.
